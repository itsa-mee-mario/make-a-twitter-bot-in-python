Go to settings and privacy > your account > account info > automation. then follow the instructions on-screen.

# Step one: make a twiiter dev account, and start a project.
Go to https://developer.twitter.com and sign up for an essential account. (or pay for one, depends on your reqs)
Go to your project settings and turn on OAuth 1 and 2, set the type of app to "automated app or bot" and give it read and write (and message) perms in OAuth 1 settings. Add the url to your project homepage where needed. 


# Step three: get your api keys.
Theres a couple things here that you need to get from your twitter developer console, so get them.
  - consumer key
  - consumner secret
  - access token
  - access secret

# You're ready to code.
Look at the code in the repo for that.
